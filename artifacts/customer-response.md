**Resetting an iPhone – Quick FAQ**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **How do I do a “soft” reset (restart) on my iPhone?** | 1. Press and hold the **Volume Up** button, then the **Volume Down** button. <br> 2. Keep holding until the **Apple logo** appears (≈10 seconds). <br> 3. Release the buttons and wait for your iPhone to reboot. |
| **How do I erase everything and restore factory settings?** | 1. Open **Settings** → **General** → **Transfer or Reset iPhone**. <br> 2. Tap **Erase All Content & Settings**. <br> 3. Confirm, then enter your pass‑code or Apple ID password. <br> 4. The device will wipe and restart as a new iPhone. |
| **What if my iPhone won’t respond to a soft reset?** | • **Force‑restart**: Press and release **Volume Up**, then **Volume Down**, then press and hold the **Side** button until the Apple logo appears. <br> • If it still won’t boot, connect to a computer and use iTunes/Finder to restore it. |
| **Do I lose my data after a reset?** | A soft reset keeps all data. A factory reset deletes all personal data. Back up to iCloud or a computer before performing a factory reset. |
| **Can I reset my iPhone without a passcode?** | You’ll need the passcode or Apple ID credentials to complete a factory reset. If you’ve forgotten them, use **Find My iPhone** (on another device or iCloud.com) to erase the device remotely. |

> **Tip:** Keep your iPhone’s software updated—go to **Settings** → **General** → **Software Update**. An up‑to‑date device is less likely to need a reset!
