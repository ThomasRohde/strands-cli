- **Superposition enables parallelism**: Quantum bits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing algorithms to evaluate many possibilities at once, vastly accelerating search and optimization tasks.  
- **Entanglement provides non‑classical correlations**: When qubits become entangled, the state of one instantly influences another regardless of distance, enabling error reduction techniques like quantum error correction and secure communication protocols.  
- **Shor’s algorithm threatens public‑key cryptography**: By factoring large integers efficiently, it can break RSA and ECC schemes, compelling a shift toward quantum‑resistant cryptographic standards.  
- **Quantum volume is the holistic performance metric**: It captures the interplay of gate fidelity, qubit connectivity, and error rates, providing a more accurate benchmark for comparing hardware progress than raw qubit counts alone.  
- **Hybrid quantum‑classical workflows are the near‑term focus**: Variational algorithms (e.g., VQE, QAOA) leverage existing noisy hardware by delegating heavy lifting to classical optimizers, making practical applications (drug discovery, material science) feasible within the current NISQ era.
